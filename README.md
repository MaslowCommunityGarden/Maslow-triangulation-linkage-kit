# Maslow triangulation linkage kit

This is a kit to build a linkage system for a Maslow CNC machine that enables triangular kinematics (as opposed to quadrilateral kinematics) for more accurate cuts and a more stable router sled. 

You will receive all of the laser cut parts and all hardware needed to assemble the linkages. Laser cut parts are 1/4" birch plywood and will arrive unsanded and unassembled. The picture above shows an assembled linkage. There is a link for full instructions for assembly and installation at the bottom of this description. 

This kit includes brackets for attaching chains!

The wait time varies but kits usually ship within 1 day of placing an order; this timeframe depends on many different factors such as availability of hardware and how many orders I am filling. If the timeline needs to change I will be sure to communicate with you. 

If you need your kit sooner than the estimated shipping date I can expedite orders for a small fee. Just contact me and let me know.

Of course if you ever have any problems or questions you can contact me and I will do what I can to help you out!
